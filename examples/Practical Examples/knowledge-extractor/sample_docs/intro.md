1. **Agent System** - Core AI agents
2. **Router** - Decides which agent to use
3. **Memory** - Stores conversation history

## Getting Started

To use this system:
- Install dependencies
- Configure your agents
- Run the main application

See `setup.txt` for installation instructions and `agents.py` for implementation details.
